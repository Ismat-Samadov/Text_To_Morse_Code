# Text_To_Morse_Code
string_to_morse_code
In this program, we define a MORSE_CODE_DICT dictionary that maps each character to its Morse Code representation. We then define a string_to_morse_code function that takes a string as input and converts it to Morse Code by looking up each character in the MORSE_CODE_DICT dictionary and appending its Morse Code representation to a list. Finally, we join the list of Morse Code representations with spaces to create the final Morse Code string.
